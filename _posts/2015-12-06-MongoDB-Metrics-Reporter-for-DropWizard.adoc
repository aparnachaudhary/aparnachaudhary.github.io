= MongoDB Metrics Reporter for DropWizard
:published_at: 2015-12-06
:hp-tags: mongodb, metrics, dropwizard, instrumentation

The second release for DropWizard metrics reporter to write data in MongoDB is available now in maven central.

This project provides a reporter for CodaHale/DropWizard Metrics library to store the metric data in MongoDB.
The source code is available in https://github.com/aparnachaudhary/mongodb-metrics-reporter

== How does it work?

. Define MetricsRegistry which is a JVM wide singleton for metric data
. Metrics Reporter is associated with the Metrics Registry
. Application services are instrumented with DropWizard Metrics
. The reporter reads the data from registry at fixed defined interval and writes this data to the MongoDB datastore is the relevant collection

== Setting Up Maven

Add the following dependency to your project's Maven POM file.


[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.aparnachaudhary</groupId>
        <artifactId>mongodb-metrics</artifactId>
        <version>${version.mongodb-reporter}</version>
    </dependency>
----

NOTE: Make sure you have a ``version.mongodb-reporter`` property declared in your POM with the current version, which is 0.0.2.

This reporter has compile time dependencies towards following libraries:

* io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-core:jar:3.1.2
* org.mongodb:mongo-java-driver:jar:3.1.1
* org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.7.13

Note that MongoDB java driver is compatible with 2.4.x, 2.6.x and 3.0.x. So as long as you use one of these versions of MongoDB; you are fine.

== Configuring the reporter

Once you add the maven dependency; next step is to create a registry and configure the reporter with it.

[source,java]
----
    // create metric registry
    MetricRegistry metricRegistry = new MetricRegistry();

    // configure the reporter
    MongoDBReporter reporter = MongoDBReporter.forRegistry(metricRegistry)
            .serverAddresses(new ServerAddress[]{new ServerAddress("192.168.99.100", 32768)}) # <1>
            .withDatabaseName("javasedemo") # <2>
            .prefixedWith("javase") # <3>
            .build();

    // Report metrics every 5 seconds to MongoDB
    reporter.start(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
----
<1> MongoDB connection details
<2> Name of the database in MongoDB
<3> Prefixes the metrics that are reported with the given identifier


Now that we have configured the registry and the reporter; next step is to perform some instrumentation.
For the demo, we use a simple metric _counter_. A counter is just a counter. You can increment or decrement its value.
You can use it, for instance, for counting the number of requests made to a particular HTTP endpoint.

[source,java]
----
    // register metric
    metricRegistry.counter("demo.counter");

    // sleep for 10 seconds so that metric is reported to MongoDB store
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(10);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
----

Executing the above program creates a collection ``counter`` in ``javasedemo`` database. 
The registered metric is prefixed with _javase_. Note that the prefix is not mandatory.

*Counter collection:*

[source]
----
/* 0 */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("565b3b7ec8f3530f3a327001"),
    "name" : "javase.demo.counter",
    "count" : 1,
    "timestamp" : ISODate("2015-11-29T17:53:02Z")
}

/* 1 */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("565b3b83c8f3530f3a327005"),
    "name" : "javase.demo.counter",
    "count" : 1,
    "timestamp" : ISODate("2015-11-29T17:53:07Z")
}

The sample applications for usage of DropWizard metric in JavaSE and JavaEE applications are also available in GitHub repo https://github.com/aparnachaudhary/mongodb-metrics-demo.

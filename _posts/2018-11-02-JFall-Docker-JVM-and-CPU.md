With the increasing adoption of cloud native technologies and containerization; the gap between Java development and system administration is decreasing. Whether you are using Docker Swarm, Kubernetes or Mesos/Marathon as a container orchestrator; fundamental challenges for running docker in production are common.

In this talk, I would like to share some of the basic linux concepts about CPU scheduling every Java Developer should know to be able to perform effective configuration and troubleshooting for docker containers.

Yes, Docker provides isolation, but only if you know how best to configure it.
